            <h2>Fungal Nail Infections</h2>
            <p>Fungal nails appear thick, brittle and discoloured</p>
            <p>As the infection resides on the skin under the nail, most topical treatments have low success rates - the lacquer cannot penetrate the thick nail.</p>
            <p>Traditionally it has been difficult to test for presence a fungal nail infection, though recently a 5 min test has been developed. It is available at our clinic at a cost of <strong>£40</strong>. 
            <p></p>
<!--        <h2>We offer two effective treatments for fungal nail infection:</h2>
            <h3>The Lacuna Method</h3>
            <p>A series of holes are drilled into the nail and a spray fungicide is applied.</p>
            <img class = "pod small" src = "images/drilling.JPG" alt = "Lacuna Method"/>
            <p>Initial drilling requires a half hour appointment at <strong>£150</strong>.</p>
            <p>There is a 6 weekly return necessary until the nail  has grown clear  at the normal appointment cost of <strong>£34</strong>.</p>

            <p>We now offer laser treatment of fungal nail infections.</p>
            <p>The Lunula treatment involves a cold laser. The safe and painless treatment poses none of the risks and harmful side effects of oral anti-fungal medications.</p>
            <img class = "pod" src = "images/lunula-foot.jpg" alt = "Lunula Laser Treatment"/>
            <p>Treatment causes no side effects and no recovery time is required, meaning you can go straight back to normal activities</p>

          <div class="tab-content">
            <h2>Bio-mechanical Assessment</h2>
            <p>At the Foot and Gait clinic we are interested in the function of the lower limb and the movement of the body. The feet are the foundation of the body and the body pivots over the foot during movement. Malalignments in the feet can be reflected higher up the body causing knee, the hip, the lower back problems.</p>
            <p>These discrepancies are repeated thousands of times a day - every step for decades.</p>
            <p>The feet are able to form the dual function of being stable enough to take a load and mobile enough to move. They can adapt to all sorts of terrain, they shock absorb and they give propulsion. The foot is beautifully designed to cope with all this if all the joints are functioning properly. Any disruption that alters the way the feet meet or leave the ground sets up a chain of pain and dysfunction.</p>
            <p>For <strong>30 years</strong> we have been studying and treating foot and gait problems and have pioneered a selection of effective techniques.</p>
            <p>We like to have an initial 1 hour appointment. Please come with a selection of worn footwear and a pair of shorts. We assess the mobility of the joints and video the feet in action, either walking or running. The video is slowed down and viewed. From this we decide on a treatment plan. We may make a temporary pair of insoles for you to trial, which will change the angles of the foot during gait. These are tailor-made to your feet on-site for you to try. We can adjust these easily as necessary. Once we are happy with the prescription we can take a cast and make a more permanent pair.</p>
            <p>If we decide insoles are not required we may prescribe exercises, stretching regimes, strapping and shoe advice.</p>
