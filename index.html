    <h2>Coronavirus Update</h2>
    <p>Following further government updates, we will open our practice on Monday 6th April.</p>
    <p>We will be offering:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Emergency Treatment for Patients</li>
    <li>Treatment for At Risk Patients</li>
    <li>Treatment for Key Workers </li>
    <li>Treatment for Patients in Pain</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
    <p>Treatments will be available virtually, as home visits and on site at The Foot and Gait Clinic. Please ring for an appointment and we will triage you over the phone.</p>
    <p>We cannot treat patients who either are currently unwell with COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has. As per government guidelines, these people should isolate for up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>When you attend an appointment at The Foot and Gait Clinic, we would ask you to please wait in our car park at the back of the practice. This will avoid the use of our waiting room. We will bring you into the clinic at your appointment time.</p>
    <p>Our practice is purpose built, spacious and easy to clean. We are spacing our appointments to ensure social distancing and to undertake vigorous cleaning regimes before and after each patient.</p>
    <p>We have provided a hand washing station as you come into the practice and ask you to please wash your hands on arrival. We are also using contactless payments to minimise contact.</p>
    <p>If you have any worries or concerns, please ring, there is always someone at the end of the phone, 9am-5pm Monday-Friday.</p>
    <p>Take care all, keep well and safe,</p>
    <p>Best Wishes,</p>
    <p>Marian, Alastair and the rest of The Foot and Gait Clinic Team</p>

    <h2>Welcome to The Foot & Gait Clinic</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Our foot and gait clinic started 30 years ago in 1987 in
Taunton. We have gradually expanded over the years, until finally we moved to our purpose built premises here at 31 Bridge Street.</p>
    <p>We have always worked in joint practices, feeling that the best treatments
for our patients come from sharing knowledge and skills from practitioners
that are experts in their fields.</p>
    <p>Over the years we have built up wonderful working relationships with
Osteopaths, Physiotherapists, Chiropractors and Sport's Massage
Therapists.</p>
    <p>As well as the work carried out in our practice, we also run external clinics including the following GP practices:
    <ul>
      <li>Bishops Lydeard Health Centre</li>
      <li>Comeytrowe Medical Centre</li>
      <li>Warwick House Medical Centre</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Personal Data</h3>
    <p>We ask all new patients to fill out an up-to-date <strong><a href="files/Medical_History_Form.pdf" target = "_blank">Medical History form</a></strong>. This can be downloaded from <strong><a href="files/Medical_History_Form.pdf" target = "_blank">here</a></strong> to be filled out in advance, or can filled out when you visit the practice.</p>
    <p>As part of your care we collect and securely store personal data, such as patient names and contact details. Your rights regarding this data are outlined in our downloadable privacy notice:<p>
