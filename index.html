    <h2>Coronavirus Update</h2>
    <p>OUR PRIORITY IS TO KEEP YOU ALL AS SAFE AND WELL AS POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME.</p>
    <p>We support the decision to encourage people to stay at home to reduce potentially adding to the strain put on the NHS as this time.</p>
    <p>However careful we are, however closely we follow strict government guidelines, everyone is at risk. The situation is not going away and we need to make decisions to keep everyone well and minimise the impact on the NHS.</p>
    <p>We will temporarily close our practice for in-clinic appointments and home-visits from Friday 27 March 2020. We will be taking remote phone calls and we will be receiving emails through this time so we will be able to answer any questions or concerns you may have.</p>
    <p>For our musculoskeletal therapies - physio, sport & remedial massage - we will launch virtual options and telephone consultations.</p>
    <p>The situation is continually changing and we will update you as this evolves. Thank you everyone for all of your help and support during these uncertain times.</p>
    <p>Be safe and stay home xxx</p>

    <h2>Welcome to The Foot & Gait Clinic</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Our foot and gait clinic started 30 years ago in 1987 in
Taunton. We have gradually expanded over the years, until finally we moved to our purpose built premises here at 31 Bridge Street.</p>
    <p>We have always worked in joint practices, feeling that the best treatments
for our patients come from sharing knowledge and skills from practitioners
that are experts in their fields.</p>
    <p>Over the years we have built up wonderful working relationships with
Osteopaths, Physiotherapists, Chiropractors and Sport's Massage
Therapists.</p>
    <p>As well as the work carried out in our practice, we also run external clinics including the following GP practices:
    <ul>
      <li>Bishops Lydeard Health Centre</li>
      <li>Comeytrowe Medical Centre</li>
      <li>Warwick House Medical Centre</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
